I created this after a long search on how can I learn computer vision. I was learning Tensorflow where I reached the CNN module when the idea of cv hit my head. so i am a newbie... i took help of tutorials from them I learned Opencv then searched for its various modules and libraries and finally after 2 days of work i got this much work.. if this resembles someone else's work, this maybe just a co-incidence. (Ilearned from the tutorials and this is my first code)
